# masterlog-vue
This project is VUE CLI based front-end for generating quick and fast catalogs for business of different background. 
 
 For now the JS (JSON file) which renders the front-end is hosted on npoint.io, for your project you can find fresh copy of JSON file in public folder. 

To Update JSON file path open App.vue and replace the URL.

This is Beta version of this, soon we will have auto JSON generation and some optimizations in JSON data.
